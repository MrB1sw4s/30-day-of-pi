Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.

Let’s get to know the hardware and the variations of which we will be using. We can go straight buying a pi on the 1st day but it can be a bit of overwhelming as there are quite a bit of variations. In between different versions of Raspberry pi there are also different versions of RAM quantities and the hardware kits and accessories.

Let’s make our choice easier.

<h3>The A Series:</h3>

sounds cool eh.. feels like premium cars. But ironically the A series offers the lowest cost models. If you need to seriously reduce your power usage or have a very tight budget, you can utilise it without a doubt.

Just be aware that you will only receive the essential minimum.For instance, the Raspberry Pi A versions lack an Ethernet interface, have only one USB port, and have extremely little RAM in comparison to other, more capable variants.

<h3>The B Series:</h3>

For a little bit more money, the model B series provides the best performance.
Additionally, you receive every component, such as an Ethernet port and additional USB ports.

<h3>The Zero Series:</h3>

The smallest and least expensive Raspberry Pi is the Raspberry Pi Zero.

It provides fresh possibilities because it is almost half the size of prior versions.
If you want something discrete or continuous power, this is the best choice.
The Zero may be used for projects like a little surveillance camera, a homemade Game Boy, or even a weather station.

There is W and WH subseries in Pi variations. The difference between them is for the WH version the GPIO headers are already soldered onto the board.

<h3>Now it’s your time to choose the model.</h3> 



<h3>Now … did I tell you that Raspberry Pi is essentially just like a motherboard. As like a computer you will be needing accessorises with it.</h3>

 Here is a list of what you’ll probably need to use your new Raspberry Pi:

• An SD Card (mandatory)

• A power input (mandatory)

• A screen cable or adapter

• A case

• Heatsinks or a fan

• A mouse and keyboard

<h3>where to buy?</h3> might go to your nearest retailer or online shopping site. My recommendation is to compare the costs of all the available choices.

Buying kits on Amazon is frequently the most affordable choice or even the only one.

But it's worth performing your own investigation because other resellers can offer intriguing promotional discounts.
