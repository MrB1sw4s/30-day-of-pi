now for the day 2 ...

as we have our pi in our hand let's take a look inside what the components are.

<img src="/misc/pi.png">

we have taken a raspberry pi 4 for an example and here are the main components

A: GPIO Pins

B: Wireless Card

C: Processor (CPU)

D: Memory (RAM)

E: Display connector (DSI)

F: Ethernet port

G: 2x USB3 ports

H: 2x USB2 ports

I: USB-C power input

J: Micro HDMI display output (screen 1)

K: Micro HDMI display output (screen 2)

L: Camera connector

M: Jack 3.5 mm output


the GPIO pins are here to allow the pi to create a link between the pi and external components.we will lwarn about it in the next days. we can plug extension boards here or wire it up to create our own electronic circuit. we will see about it later.
the display connector is for an external screen.

camera connector is also similar.

there is also a sd card mount holder in the back of the board. this is important as this sd card holds the boot os for the pi.
