we are on day 3 and today is the last day of introduction os the hardware we are using.

we will discuss about the storage and the operating system today.

<h3>SD Card</h3>
so when we boot up the computer or we store any data where does the machine boot from or where the data is saved? yes the answer is hard disk. but we don't have a hard disk with the raspberry pi or a sata port on it. so what can we do? we have a SD card slot on our pi and that's it all..

should it solve the matter? yess the SD card is the hard disk or the storage unit of the raspberry pi from where we will boot our os or we will store our data. we will install our operating system on this card. it works at a speed of a hard drive almost but an SSD will be 2 o 5 times faster. 

we can have several cards with different projects installed on it.

<h3>Operating System</h3>
the last thing we need to know about Raspberry Pi is that which os we can use on it.
There are different options than on your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux). Most often, Linux is used.
While there are a few more, Linux distributions would constitute the majority.
Raspbian is the primary Linux distribution for Raspberry Pi.
here are the list for different os available for Raspberry pi


Raspbian OS : Raspbian is our top choice for the finest Raspberry Pi downloaded operating systems.

Combining Raspberry and Debian results in the name Raspbian. It is based on Debian and customised for the hardware of the Raspberry Pi. We will have roughly 15 days to work on Raspbian during the process. 


If you have experience with the desktop version, Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS are similar.
Retropie: a retro-gaming enthusiast
OSMC: an easy-to-build media centre
A specific version of Windows designed for the Raspberry Pi is Windows 10 IoT.
The good news is that Debian is also the foundation for the majority of them.
